h2. What is Charyb?

Charyb is a tool to help suck down data and shove them into a simple datawarehouse.

There are two parts, the web interface and the crawler.  

The web interface makes it easier to suck in data from different mime types.  
Because data scraping isn't yet fully automated, there needs to be a little bit 
of human intervention. 

The crawler makes use of the data humans entered to figure out how to scrape the 
data.  It will keep checking those data sources as updates.

h2. To run it
